Simple, yet funny game you can play everyday. It's terminal based, and it basically generates random integer from 1 to 100 (you can change this in code), and then asks you to guess it. As you are entering your values, it'll prompt you with messages like "Nearly there!", "Try again." and "Correct!". 

Another day, another challenge. :)
